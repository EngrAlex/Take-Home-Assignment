This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook detailing the implementation of two deep learning algorithms for object detection (YOLOv8 and R-CNN). A corresponding Word document provides a comprehensive analysis of the algorithms' performance, comparing their speed, accuracy in object detection, and the confidence levels assigned to detected objects. Then comments on why texture and color analysis are added to extracted information.
